# pudding

Pudding is a python module for converting any text into a structured format.
Using a `.pud` file it matches the content and creates the desired output.
It is the successor of ![Gelatin](https://github.com/knipknap/Gelatin) and uses mostly the same language.
Changes in the syntax language can be seen in the chapter below.

It is written completely in Python and fully customizable.
